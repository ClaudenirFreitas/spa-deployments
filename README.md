Supporting resources for deployment of SPA code examples which use the [Token Handler Pattern](https://curity.io/resources/learn/the-token-handler-pattern/).\
The token handler manages OAuth work for the SPA and issues secure cookies to use in the browser:

## Deployment Steps

Deployment on development computer involves the following main steps:

| Step | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Prerequisites | Ensuring that the correct prerequisite tools are installed |
| Build Code | Building code and dependencies into Docker images |
| Configure SSL Trust | Ensuring that development certificates are trusted by the system |
| Deploy the System | Deploying the Curity Identity Server and other supporting components |
| Run the SPA | Browsing to the SPA and signing in as the preconfigured user account |

## Running an End-to-End Flow

Start with the main SPA repository, and follow the instructions in these pages:

- [Basic SPA using an Authorization Code Flow (PKCE) and a Client Secret](https://github.com/curityio/web-oauth-via-bff/doc/Basic.md)
- [Financial-grade SPA using Mutual TLS, PAR and JARM](https://github.com/curityio/web-oauth-via-bff/doc/Financial.md)

## Token Handler Implementations

For a deeper understanding, the token handler can be run in isolation via these repos:

- [Basic Token Handler in Node.js](https://github.com/curityio/bff-node-express)
- [Financial-grade Token Handler in Kotlin](https://github.com/curityio/token-handler-kotlin-spring-fapi)
