Work from this folder to get components up, then test with the SPA

INTEGRATION TASKS
-----------------
1. Get Kong using SSL
   Find where SSL certs should go and whether I can use the p12 file?

2. Get SPA basically running, though with some errors, especially around Mutual TLS
   I would expect redirects to basically work though

3. Automate the client cert
   Improve the Dockerfile

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
1. Branch bff-node-express
   Use a /tokenhandler path to fix userInfo requests
   Improve config handling to use environment variables
