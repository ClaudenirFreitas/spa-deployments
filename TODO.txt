Work from this folder to get components up before testing from the SPA

FIRST
-----
1. Read up about Java deployment - resource files when deploying to Docker
   Use environment variables to override configuration perhaps
   Look at certificate I was provided with
   Talk to Michal

TODO
----
1. Get reverse proxy up with SSL and requests going through correctly
   Find where SSL certs should go and whether I can use the p12 file?

2. Set the Identity Server SSL certificates dynamically and get this URL working
   Use Mutual TLS API approach of RESTCONF
   https://login.example.com:8443/oauth/v2/oauth-anonymous/.well-known/openid-configuration

ISSUES
------
1. Problem due to bff-node-express using a /bff path which breaks userInfo requests
   Tests work OK for the HTTP case
   Create a branch of both the SPA and the Node Express token handler
