Work from this folder to get components up, then test with the SPA

INTEGRATION TASKS
-----------------
1. Get reverse proxy calling these URLs:
   curl -k https://login-internal.example.com:8443/oauth/v2/oauth-anonymous/.well-known/openid-configuration
   curl -k -i -X POST https://api-internal.example.com:3002/data
   curl -k -i -X POST https://tokenhandler-internal.example.com:8080/login/start

2. Get SPA basically running, though with some errors, especially around Mutual TLS
   I would expect redirects to basically work though

3. Automate the client cert
   Improve the Dockerfile

4. Run tests against both local and deployed api
   Should certs live in the API project?

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
1. Branch bff-node-express
   Use a /tokenhandler path to fix userInfo requests
   Improve config handling to use environment variables
