Work from this folder to get components up, then test with the SPA

INTEGRATION TASKS
-----------------
1. Get reverse proxy calling these URLs:
   curl -k https://login-internal.example.com:8443/oauth/v2/oauth-anonymous/.well-known/openid-configuration
   curl -k -i -X POST https://api-internal.example.com:3002/data
   curl -k -i -X POST https://tokenhandler-internal.example.com:3001/login/start

2. Get SPA basically running, though with some errors, especially around Mutual TLS
   I would expect redirects to basically work though

ENVIRONMENT
-----------
1. Branch bff-node-express
   Use a /tokenhandler path to fix userInfo requests
   Improve config handling to use environment variables
